# Quick Start - Manual GitHub Setup

## üöÄ Start Here (Manual Approach)

Since GitHub CLI authentication is being problematic, let's use the web interface:

### 1. Go to Your Repository
Navigate to: https://github.com/Epistemic-Me/recipe-chatbot

### 2. Create Your First Issue Manually

Click **Issues** ‚Üí **New Issue** ‚Üí **Get Started** next to "Learning Issue"

**Title**: `Epic 0.1 - Setup Learning Repository and Documentation Framework`

**Copy this body**:
```markdown
## Learning Objective
Establish systematic documentation practices and create reusable evaluation frameworks for the complete AI evals learning journey.

## Connection to AI Evals Framework
This provides the foundation for documenting learnings throughout the Analyze-Measure-Improve lifecycle.

## Tasks
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation structure
- [ ] Set up learning templates and best practices
- [ ] Establish GitHub workflow patterns with proper branching
- [ ] Create issue and PR templates for systematic learning capture
- [ ] Set up project board with proper workflow columns

## Learning Goals
- **Primary Skill**: Systematic learning documentation and knowledge management
- **Secondary Skills**: GitHub project management and workflow design
- **Connection**: Enables systematic capture of evaluation methodology learnings

## Deliverables
- [ ] **Code**: Documentation templates and workflow configurations
- [ ] **Documentation**: Learning framework and best practices guide
- [ ] **Analysis**: Documentation strategy and methodology

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All documentation templates created and tested
- [ ] GitHub project board configured with proper workflow
- [ ] Issue and PR templates validated
- [ ] Learning capture methodology documented
- [ ] PR created with comprehensive setup

## Learning Notes
[Space for capturing insights about systematic learning documentation]

## Claude Code Best Practices Applied
- [ ] Systematic file organization and navigation
- [ ] Concurrent tool usage for efficient setup
- [ ] Proper documentation structure
```

**Labels**: `epic-0`, `setup`, `documentation`, `learning-foundation`

### 3. Set Up Project Board
1. Go to **Projects** tab
2. Click **New Project**
3. Choose **Board** layout
4. Name it: "AI Evals Learning Journey"
5. Create columns:
   - üìã Backlog
   - üî¨ In Analysis
   - üíª In Development
   - üìù In Documentation
   - üîç In Review
   - ‚úÖ Done

### 4. Start Working!
```bash
git checkout -b feature/epic-0-1-setup
```

### 5. Complete the First Issue

The templates and documentation are already created in your repo:
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/learning-issue.md`
- `.github/pull_request_template.md`  
- `AI_EVALS_LEARNING_FRAMEWORK.md`
- `COMPLETE_HOMEWORK_GITHUB_PLAN.md`

You can move straight to implementing the first issue!

## üéØ Alternative: CLI Setup Fix

If you want to try fixing GitHub CLI:

```bash
# Clear any existing config
rm -rf ~/.config/gh/

# Try fresh authentication
gh auth login --web --scopes repo,project

# Or use token method
gh auth login --with-token
# Then paste a personal access token
```

## üöÄ Bottom Line

**Don't let CLI issues block your learning!** 

The manual approach works perfectly and you can start implementing your learning journey immediately. The systematic approach and templates are what matter most.
