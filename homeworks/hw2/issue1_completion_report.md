# Issue #1 Completion Report: Recipe Bot Trace Generation

## 📋 Summary
Successfully completed Issue #1 for HW2 error analysis by running the Recipe Bot on all synthetic queries and generating comprehensive interaction traces.

## ✅ Tasks Completed

### 1. Environment Setup
- ✅ Installed all required dependencies (litellm, judgy, etc.)
- ✅ Verified environment configuration (.env file with MODEL_NAME and API keys)
- ✅ Confirmed Recipe Bot functionality

### 2. Bulk Test Execution
- ✅ Ran bulk test script on all synthetic queries from `synthetic_queries_for_analysis.csv`
- ✅ Processed all 250 synthetic queries successfully
- ✅ Generated comprehensive bot responses with detailed recipes

### 3. Results Generation
- ✅ Created complete trace file: `hw2_bot_traces_20250613.csv`
- ✅ Verified all 250 queries were processed
- ✅ Ensured traces include both user queries and complete bot responses

## 📊 Results Overview

**Input File:** `homeworks/hw2/synthetic_queries_for_analysis.csv`
- Total queries: 250
- Query types: Diverse dietary restrictions, cuisine preferences, cooking complexity levels

**Output File:** `homeworks/hw2/hw2_bot_traces_20250613.csv`
- Total lines: 11,487 (including headers and multiline responses)
